# drop_table_V1

This is my Brighter Shores Drop Table project.

I'm not sure if providing the db I have collected so far is fine, but it's there.
If you're here, can run the code, why wouldn't you want to see pre-collected data?

Sure IF you want here's a run down of the program:

Open command line.

Navigate to the folder with the 'main.py' script

type: 'python main.py'

Select an option from the main menu, follow the prompts

While tracking kills if you enter the wrong the information you can simply enter a blank response.

This will kick you out.

You will have to re enter the data but it will not post the incorrect data into the db.

You can view monsters by kill. 'va' to view all kills then from main menu: 'vm' and type monster name to view drops by monster.



Future changes:

V1 and it's db will remain in the state that they are in now, forever.

I'm going to make a V2 which tracks everything in V1 plus:

-date/time of drop

-coin drops

Massive Changes (for me):

V2+ Everything listed above plus:

-separate tables for: 'armor', 'weapons', 'ingredient drops/materials drops' and 'monsters'

**This was going to be part of V1 but the complexity became way too much for my beginner hands to handle at the moment


-comprehensive information about:

--'armor', 'weapons', 'ingredients/materials', and 'monsters'
